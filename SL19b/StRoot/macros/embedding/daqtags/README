The following instructions are for preparation of the daq/reco(MuDst)/tags files for embedding productions, only applicable at RCF.
Make sure you have the 'write' permissions (better run as the user "starembd") in /star/embed/ sub-directories, where those files
will be stored.

Step 1:
modify daq.sh, change the file type (e.g. st_physics_adc), trgsetupname, and/or the run range or add other conditions if necessary.
run ./daq.sh to obtain the full list of available daq files on HPSS for a specific data configuration. 
the list filename MUST end with .daq.list, "all.daq.list" will be used below as an example.
NOTE that trgword is not a reliable keyword in get_file_list.pl, so do not use it in the conditions to select daq files.
NOTE2: ONLY those st_XXX_adc daq files contain the raw ADC data, hence can be used for embedding.

Step 2:
obtain the list of good runs or bad runs from PA. (ignore this step if both of them can not be provided)
MUST name it as goodruns.txt or badruns.txt, then run 
./keepgood.sh all.daq.list 
to produce the daq list (good_all.daq.list) from good runs only.

Step 3:
use the following command to randomly sample some daq files from the good_all.daq.list, and monitor the number of runs sampled.
./getruns.sh good_all.daq.list 500 | sort | uniq | wc -l
usually 500 daq files are sufficient for minimum bias events, for the rare triggers (like HT), increase this number accordingly
to increase the statistics in one sample. the file list for these 500 files is named as good_all.500.daq.list automatically.

Step 4:
to estimate the disk space needed for restaging those daq files to disks, run
./getsize.sh good_all.500.daq.list
usually, the total volume should be below 5TB (due to limited disk space), it will be better if it is less than 2TB.
the script also provide the total # of events in this data sample. note that the number is for all events (all triggers are included).
please ignore the nevents_* file produced by this script, it is only used for embedding into zerobias events.

Step 5:
run 
./getmudst.sh good_all.500.daq.list P16ij
to get the list of MuDst and tags files corresponding to those 500 daq files, P16ij is the corresponding real data production ID.
MuDst files are used for base QA and/or moretags files production.
tags files are used in embedding production for providing the PV position and refmult, etc.

Step 6:
MODIFY and run
./mkdir.sh
to create the daq/reco/tags directory at /star/embed
please do change the year and directory names in mkdir.sh first!
this script also links back those directories.

Step 7:
MODIFY and run
./restage.sh
to restage the daq/reco/tags files to daq/reco/tags directory.
please do change the filelist names in restage.sh first!
You can use 
hpss_user.pl -p 
to inspect the progress.

Step 8:
sometimes, some files in daq/reco/tags directories can not be restaged for some reasons, need to remove all of those files that have 
either type of file missing. run 
./trimdata.sh
to delete those files.

Step 9:
in case that moretags files are needed, use the following command to checkout the latest scripts for making moretags files. 
(ignore this step if moretags is not needed.)
cvs co -d moretags StRoot/macros/embedding/moretags 
follow the moretags/README to produce moretags.root files, and/or chop the daq files if necessary.

Other tools:
daqAdder.sh, tagAdder.sh
the tools to combine the daq/tags/moretags files from the same runnumber. used in some rare case that each chopped daq files contains 
only tens of events (for example, AuAu7 data). combining the daq files from the same runs can help reduce the job numbers, 
hence increase the running efficiency significantly.
please look into these scripts to know how to use them.
