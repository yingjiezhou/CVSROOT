 * HOWTO
 * =====
 * 
 * Basically, there are 4 steps to get the final calibration parameters as 
 * an input for the database. 
 *
 * 0) Soft Links
 * -------------
 * create some soft links in your working directory first:
 * ln -s StRoot/StBTofPool/alignment/doMuDstEvents.C doMuDstEvents.C
 * ln -s StRoot/StBTofPool/alignment/submit_xml_list.sh submit_xml_list.sh
 * ln -s StRoot/StBTofPool/alignment/analysis analysis
 * ln -s <your root output dir> rootout
 * 
 * 1) Create some ntuples from MuDst via doMuDstEvents.C
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 *
 * You don't need to modify any code under StRoot/, all the necessary choices 
 * can be picked up using the public functions of StBTofMatchMaker.
 * The macro doMuDstEvents.C tells you how to switch on/off these 
 * options. So to perform alignment calculation, use 
 * StBTofMatchMaker::setCalculateAlign(kTRUE), it will tell the program to open the local z 
 * cut, and the geometry to also start from the initial ideal geometry. One 
 * can also check the residuals with the parameters from step 4 applied, to confirm 
 * these alignment constants by StBTofMatchMaker::setAlignFileName("xxxxx"). "xxxxx" is 
 * the final output file after step 4.
 *
 * submit_xml_list.sh:
 * For submitting jobs to the batch farm the script submit_xml_list.sh
 * is distributed with the package. It calls doMuDstEvents.C and generates
 * xml files to be send to the batach farm. It takes a filelist as an argument. See below
 * on how to create this filelist. By default,'rootout' is set as output directory and
 * 'lis' as input directory for filelists. Set the 'workdir' variable to your
 * needs in the scripts. 'starver dev' is used.
 * run it in c-shell!!
 *
 * filelist:
 * - generate text file with absolute links to all st_physics root files of fast offline data
 * - split this file ('InputList') via
 * 	$ split -l NrFilesPerJob InputList Prefix
 * - append '.lis' to generated split lists
 * - generate filelist with all .lis split files (no .lis ending in this filelist!)
 * 	this list serves as input to submit_xml_list.sh
 * 
 * 2) Loop ntuples created in step 1 to generate histograms for further fitting
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The main program is analysis.cxx and you can find its 
 * dependency on other files from the GNUmakefile. So after this step, you 
 * will have a root file containing all necessary histograms for offline 
 * fitting.
 * compile the program:
 * 	make 
 * run the resulting program 'analysis' to generate all needed histograms
 * 	argument = <your root output directory> from step 1. All files in the directory are chained.
 * 	output = 'align.root' (fixed, change in analysis.cxx if necessary)
 * 
 * 3) Fitting to get local offsets in each dimension
 * -------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The following two macros need to be executed in this step. They both load 'fitfunc.C'.
 * - getY0.C  - for local y offset
 * - getX0.C  - to extract x,z offsets simultaneously
 * 
 * 	argument = TString align_file (from step 2)
 * 	outputs = x(y)FitPar.root & x(y)Offset.dat
 *
 * 4) Generate the final file for db uploading macro
 * -------------------------------------------------
 *
 * execute 'genOffset.C' to generate final DB upload file. Change the workdir to point to
 * the directory containing x(y)Offset.dat from step 3.
 * 
 * You might want to do steps 3 and 4 on your local machine.
 * 
 * REITERATE
 * =========
 *
 * Sometimes, I do a second iteration if the residuals seen are still 
 * finite, this is probably because some correlations between y and z 
 * offsets. So basically after applying the first set of alignment 
 * parameters, I repeat 1-4 a second time, then the final parameters 
 * will be just sum of two steps. You can see actually in the genOffset.C 
 * in 4, I basically add two sets of parameters together.
 * Change the script according to your number of reiterations.
 * Make sure to set the right alignment input file in step 1 by switching from
 * ideal geometry to the setAlignFileName() before reiterating.
