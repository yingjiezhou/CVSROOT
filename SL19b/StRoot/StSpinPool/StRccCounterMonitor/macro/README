  $run and $yearday (.i.e. 14046, or first 5 digit of run#) need to be ones available on /trg/trgdata/
         
  runs $yearday                           make runlist for a day, i.e. $yearday/run.txt from DB

  root4star -b -q TDFReader.C"($run)"     read trigger data file and make histo file=$yearday/rccqa.$run.root

  root -b -q makeqaplot.C"($run,0,1)"     read $yearday/rccqa.$run.root and create png files and a text file=$yearday/rcc.$run.txt

  makeplot $run				  run TDFReader.C, makeplot.C

  makepage,pl                just make web page for today (not running qa nor making plots)
  makepage.pl 0 run          make web page for today, and run makeplot in this process (not on condor) as needed
  makepage.pl $yearday       make web page for a day
