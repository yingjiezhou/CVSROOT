The directory contains a simple example of the transition the standalone application to ROOT loadable macro

1. MyPackageMain.cxx - this is the original stand-alone package
   You can build and execute it as follows:
   
   g++ MyPackageMain.cxx -o MyPackageMain
   MyPackageMain
   
2. MyPackage.cxx is the modified version of MyPackageMain.cxx 
   suitable to be used with ROOT ACliC. 
   The MyPackage.cxx contains the copy of the code from MyPackageMain.cxx 
   
   It can be used as follows:
   
     >  root.exe --b -q -l MyPackage.cxx+
       
3. MyPackageFancy.cxx is the modified version of MyPackage.cxx
   This file does not contain any copy of the code from MyPackageMain.cxx
   It uses the CPP
        #include "MyPackageMain.cxx" 
   instead.

   It can be used as follows:
     >  root.exe --b -q -l MyPackageFancy.cxx+

4. MyPackage.csh is the shell script to execute all 3 steps above

   > ./MyPackage.csh 
   
5. To see how it works check the package out 
   
   >  cvs co -d./ StRoot/macros/aclic
   
   and invoke the MyPackage.csh  shell script

   > ./MyPackage.csh
