  Explanation about the macros located in this directory - Marcelo Munhoz

SvtDataViewer.C -> to run the online monitor;

doSvtBadAnodes.C -> to generate bad anodes as explained in 
http://www.star.bnl.gov/~munhoz/svt/year2004/year4_hits_badAnodes_Maker.html

insertAlignedGeometry.C -> inserts new geometry in the data base. I believe I'm 
the only one with karma to touch the data base, but at least we keep the macro 
archived and other people can look at it and eventually take care of it as well.

insertBadAnodes -> the same for bad anodes

insertDriftVelocity.C -> the same for drift velocity

calcRmsFluctuation.C -> reads RMS from daq file, and plots the RMS for all 
pixels, calculate the mean RMS for each anode and the rns of it
