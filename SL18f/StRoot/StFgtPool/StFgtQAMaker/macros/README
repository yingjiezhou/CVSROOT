This is FGT offline chain monitor README
(http://www.star.bnl.gov/cgi-bin/protected/cvsweb.cgi/StRoot/StFgtPool/StFgtQAMaker/macros/README)

How to setup:

  ssh -t -A -Y rssh.rhic.bnl.gov -t -A -Y stargw.starp.bnl.gov ssh -A -Y onl0<N>
  klog
  cd <your working dir>
  cvs co StRoot/StFgtPool/StFgtQAMaker
  source StRoot/StFgtPool/StFgtQAMaker/macros/setup
 
  mkdir /onlineweb/www/fgtStatus/<your web dir>
  ln -s /onlineweb/www/fgtStatus/<your web dir> www
  mv links.php www/

  Webpage will be at http://online.star.bnl.gov/fgtStatus/<your web dir>

  You may need to adjust in makepage.pl at near top:
    $year = 14   
    $start = `date -d "Feb 6 00:00:00" +%s`; $start=~s/\n//g;
  for new RHIC run.

How to run : 

  run#s(14046056/110) and year/date(14046) need to be ones available on eventpool (/evp/a).
  First you need a good pedestal run (pedAsPhys_tcd_only or fgtPedestal) to create ped & status, then analyze physics runs.
         
  runs 14046                              make runlist for a day, i.e. 14046/run.txt and fgtrun.txt from DB

  root4star runqa.C"(14046056,1)"         runqa.C code with run#, pedestal(0 for physics)
					  creating <yearday>/ped/pedestal.txt and <yearday>/status/status.txt
  root makepedplot.C"(14046059)"          make plots for pedesral runs from ped/status text file created by runqa.C
   or
  makeplot 14046059 pedestal              run runqa.C and makepedplot.C, link pedestal.txt and status.txt to new one

  root4star runqa.C"(14046110,0,100)"     runqa.C code with run#, as physics run (1 for pedestal), and limit to 100 events, 
                                          creating <yearday>/fgtQA_<run>.root.
  root makeqaplot.C"(14046110,0,1)"       make plots for physics runs from .root file created by runqa.C, and create all plots
                                          (0 is all plots, 1 to 20 is for specific page) and make png files (0 for not saving png)
   or
  makeplot 14046110 physics               run runqa.C and makeqaplot.C (or makepedplot.C for pedestal) and copy png and pdf file to web area

  makepage.pl                just make web page for today (not running qa nor making plots)
  makepage.pl 0 submit       make web page for today, and submit makeplot job to condor as needed
  makepage.pl 0 run          make web page for today, and run makeplot in this process (not on condor) as needed
  makepage.pl 14046          make web page for day 14046

  emacs crontab.txt       edit cron jobb specification: time interval to run "makepage" job
  cron                    see if crontab is set
  cron set                setup cron job with crontab.txt. output will be send by email on your account at onlxx
  cron remove             remove cron job
